# This file shows an example of fitting to Pr2Sn2O7 data from http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.88.104421

It shows some strategies for "more sophisticated fits", such as defining the a phenomenological resolution function, fitting to peak centers as well as the scattered intensity, and multi-step fitting.
The results are comparable to the published results from SPECTRE, but differ slightly.
