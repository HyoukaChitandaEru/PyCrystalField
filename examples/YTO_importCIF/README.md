## Example: import crystal structure of Yb2Ti2O7 from a cif file, calculate a point charge model, and print the eigenvalues and neutron spectrum

The .py and .ipynb files are the same, showing how to run each in the different environments.

### Importing cif files:
Two things must be specified: the cif file, and the central ion you wish to calculate the CEF Hamiltonian for. The name of the central ion should match the name in the cif file (in this case, 'Yb1').
